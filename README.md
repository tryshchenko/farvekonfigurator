# Farvekonfigurator
üé® üñºÔ∏è üñåÔ∏è"farvekonfigurator" - from Danish - "configurator of colors";
This is a library which allows you to configure colors easily. You shouldn't think of CSS anymore - direct methods improve performance and reduce the risks of mistakes.

*Blazingly small. Just 990kb all together (1)*
*Works without NPM or Yarn required!*
*NO DEPENDENCIES!*

## Why?
Simplifying the work with CSS is our main goal.
Libraries are encapsulated and easy to use.
Styling should be modular.

## How to use
Import js files to your HTML.

Call the method background + color (hex, 3 symbols) you expect to use.
```
    document.querySelector('.my-class').background0f0();
    document.querySelector('.my-class').background8ae();
```
And for colors either: color + color (hex, 3 symbols)
```
    document.querySelector('.my-class').color00a();
    document.querySelector('.my-class').color2ae();
```
